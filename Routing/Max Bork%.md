Need to do the full first loop to get the roads to Clifton and Aldhurst.
Second cycle go to Pachenko and immediately return to meet Thunder the first time (3 Borks).
For cycles 3 and 5 (only if needed), go straight to Clifton and talk to Thunder if he's there (1 Bork), then go to Aldhurst and talk to Thunder if he's there (2 Borks).
This gives the total of 6 Borks that are possible in game (that we know of). Skip cycle 4, since the only Thunder interaction in that cycle is `dog_consolation`.

On any given cycle, Thunder has a 4/9 chance to be in a particular location. This means there is a 1/6 chance that he is in both locations for cycle 3.
