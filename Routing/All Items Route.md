- **fish pie:** 
    - Concordance with Talia
- **licorice:**

    - Concordance with Alexis once they've moved to Bukam Boro.
    - Concordance with Klaus in Clifton if she's the initial character there.

    - Concordance with Haruto post-cataclysm if XN-220 has regained their memories.
- **matcha:** 
    - Concordance with Matilde in intro, unless it's the first cycle and you aren't with the caravan.
    - Concordance with Matilde, except when distracting her for Klaus, and when she is mourning Miriam.
- **bartow keyring:** 
    - Always received from Elias at the end of the first loop.
    - Depending on many factors, Elias may give you a keyring in the Epilogue.
- **succulents:**

    - Concordance with Alexis in 3rd or 4th cycle.
    - Discordance with Alexis once they move to Bukam Boro.
- **painting:** 
    - Concordance with Tomas, except after he decides to stay in Pachenco (moving to Clifton means he can give painting again).

    - Concordance with Deion pre-cataclysm, except during the Cast-off.
- **red wine:**

    - Concordance with Aurora on cycle 3 or 5, except during the performance.
- **scrap:** 
    - Concordance with Big Basilio after cycle 2.
    - Concordance with Mimi after moving to Anka.
    - Concordance with Thunder in Anka.
    - Concordance with Lil' Basilio while looting, if you don't already have scrap.
    - Any outcome when Oscar breaks.
    - Concordance with Tariq while preparing for the Cast-off.
    - Discordance with Tariq when asking to repair Oscar.
- **bar soap:** 
    - Concordance with Ophelia in intro, during railroad opening celebration, and during her story resolution.
- **caladiums:** 
    - Concordance with Masha in cycle 5, if you brought back materials for her and the store is successful.

Note that I didn't include all the items that you can get back from Klaus after she steals them from you, as that isn't really a source of new items anyway.


From these, we can determine the story checks, locations, or other tricky situations that are absolutely required for certain items:
- Tosende Canals - need to get here before the cataclysm to get chillies from Oscar, the spice sampler from Maya, and the marigolds from Lars.
- Old Marae - need to talk to Tariq, Talia, and Deion.
    - May be preferable to wait for the cataclysm, if possible, so nothing gets stolen by Gull.
    - Never mind, Deion won't give the Lamprey post-cataclysm.
- Desert Oasis - need dried fruit from Theo.
- Long Gate - need Succulents from Mimi.
- Big Basilio - Must talk to on cycle 2 for the Synthesizer.
    - Also need to talk to on cycle 1 for Mobile Phone, otherwise we have to free Ramir.
- Alexis - Talk to in both first (or second) and third (or fourth) cycles for both Nuts and Crickets.
- Aurora - Talk to in cycles 1, 2 and 3 or 5 for the Ukulele, Viola, and Drum respectively.
    - Can always unlock Aurora cycle 1 by talking to whichever of Salem or Tosuto shows up in Aldhurst.
- Store Success - needed for Masha to give you the Caladiums.
    - This is difficult to avoid since we get so many items.


# The Route

Taking into account the story requirements for obtaining each item, this is an efficient option for collecting all of them in a single game:

## First trip
Follow the caravan to start with. Make sure you talk to as many people who can give items as possible. This means:
- In Pachenco, one of Isabella, Tomas, and Marques will appear first. Talk to whichever one of them appears; they won't unlock anyone until the second conversation, but they all give you an item for concordance. Also talk to Nadine to get more caravan route.
    - Marques is the best RNG here, as a concordance in her second conversation will unlock both Isabella and Tomas at the same time.
    - If Tomas is first, both others will be unlocked by Concordances with him eventually, but they unlock one at a time so it takes an extra conversation. (==TODO: check this==)
    - If Isabella is first, a concordance on the second conversation will unlock Marques, who can then unlock Tomas. Alternatively, talking to her after the Cataclysm will unlock both.
- In Clifton, talk to Alexis (or Klaus if she's there instead) to get the Nuts, and to Ramir to get the next part of the Route. Make sure to get a Discordance with Ramir, because we need to talk to Aurora in cycle 1 and there's no way to get there without following the caravan, so we don't want him wasting time asking us to go to Anka.
- In Bukam Boro, grab the Matcha from Matilde, then talk to Nadine to get the route to Aldhurst.
- In Aldhurst, there are three characters that can show up; Tosuto, Salem, and Aurora. If you don't get Aurora, **your run is dead**. So yay, 1/3 RNG check that just immediately kills the run if you don't get it.
